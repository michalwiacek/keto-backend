#
# hosts:
#   XX.XX.XX.XX:
#   yourdomain.com:
#
# All your hosts (or the only host) to provision for givern group.
# Group names correspond to specific software to be installed and provisioned
# and are described in README
#
# All groups are provisioned with basic configuration described in group_vars/all.yml
#
# Group specific config is in group_vars/<role_name>.yml
#
# Be carefull with spaces, it's YAML baby :)
#
# The most simple case: you use the same VPS host for each group — all live together

      hosts:

#=============================================
# You can add multiple app groups with unique names `passenger-nginx-app-*`
#    passenger-nginx-app-2:
#      hosts:
#        (same host different app | different host another app):
#
# It's also handy for staging rollout.

# You can add multiple postgres groups with unique names `postgres-*`
# with their own unique configs
